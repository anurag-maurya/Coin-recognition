# Coin-recognition

After their gaming startup PlayDoom couldn’t garner funding in the Entrepreneurship Summit, the team of Bhadage, Bansal and Pandey decided to give up on their startup and go on a world trip to follow their passion of numismatics (collection of coins). They travel to various countries and collect coins of various denominations to add to their collection.

Now, they’ve hired a data scientist Madhup to create a tool to predict countries from their coin currencies, by making use of their marvellous coin collection.
